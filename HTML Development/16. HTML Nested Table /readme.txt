We have nested the last section' table in a new/ parent table here.


The code for the parent/ new table is:
<table width="100%" border="1" bordercolor="red" cellspcaing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
      <td>
       ...
      </td>

  </tr>
</table>


For nesting the previous section table just add the last section' code between <td> & </td> here (...) part.

As per the first (nested) table width is set 500 pixels and the width of the external/ parent table is 100% which will be displayed at 100% irrespective of the browser window size.
